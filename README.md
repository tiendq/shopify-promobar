Shopify Promobar
================

# History
This simple app was built during my adventure with Shopify. It was deployed on Shopify and used by real websites. Basically it has an UI to manage a small banner which can be displayed at the top/bottom of an website e.g. sales announcement in online stores. There might be broken changes in Shopify API but it's a good example if you want to build a Shopify app with React/NodeJS.
